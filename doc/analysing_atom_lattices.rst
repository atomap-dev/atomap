Analysing atom lattices
=======================

After finding and refining the atom lattices as shown in ref:`finding_atom_lattices` , the atomic structure can be analysed through

1. The distance between neighbouring atoms
2. Monolayer separation
3. Ellipticity of the atomic columns
4. (Intensity)
