Welcome to Atomap's documentation!
==================================

Atomap is a Python library for analysing atomic resolution
scanning transmission electron microscopy images.
It relies in fitting 2-D Gaussian functions to every atomic
column in an image, and automatically find all major symmetry
axes. The full procedure is explained in the article 
`Atomap: a new software tool for the automated analysis of
atomic resolution images using two-dimensional
Gaussian fitting <https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40679-017-0042-5>`_.

Instructions on how to install Atomap are found in the :ref:`install` guide.

There is a :ref:`tutorial` on how to use Atomap.

The source code is found in the `GitLab repository <https://gitlab.com/atomap/atomap/tree/master/>`_.

Atomap is under development and is in alpha, so bugs and errors can be expected.
Bug reports and feature requests are welcome on the `issue tracker <https://gitlab.com/atomap/atomap/issues>`_.

Atomap is available under the GNU GPL v3 license.
